= Distributed Systems SS2024 
:toc:

This repository holds the code for a chat application written in python. The application is part of the project assignment for the course "Distributed Systems" at Reutlingen University / University of Stuttgart.

== Requirements
The application satisfies the following requirements, defined by the project assignment:

Dynamic Discovery of Hosts:: New clients and servers need to be initiated by dynamic discovery.
Voting:: Every time a new server joins a system or an existing one fails, a election is held to select a leader.
Fault Tolerance:: In order to ensure consistent operation of the system, failures need to be detected and dealt with accordingly.

== Architecture

.Dynamic Discovery
New server and client join the network:

Existing servers respond:

.Communication between clients

== Components

=== Server 
To start a server locally, simply run: 

[,python]
----
server.py
----

Once the server instance is started, it will broadcast its IP adress and PID to the broadcast group and trigger an election amongst all servers in the network.

=== Client
To start a client locally, simply run: 

[,python]
----
client.py
----
Once the new client instance is started, it will broadcast its IP adress and PID to the broadcast (server-) group. The leading server will then respond with its own information and the communication of clients via the leading server can begin.
